# ARP-spoofing-detection-ClickOS

ARP poisoning is the process when an attacker sniffs the IP of one of the victim in a same subnet and sends an unicast unsolicited ARP responses (with it’s mac address and victim’s IP address) to another host/router in the same subnet. ARP protocol being stateless, the host/router updates its ARP table with falsified MAC and IP addresses. Because of this, any packets routed from host/switch to the victim gets directed to attacker. With the Man In The Middle Attack (MITM), the attacker can sniff entire packets directed to the host.
This project deals with designing click elements which parses the packet and listens for ARP responses over a channel and deploys action kill or forward the packet based on the mapping of the IP -MAC address previously stored in the click element. 

# Steps for running the project:

# Step a: Setting the environment:
1.	Download the cmpe210_clickos.ova from the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EtM_UH6qgGdeyAlKsHgu6DXTqzfch4e/view?usp=sharing (Links to an external site.) 
•	Username: ubuntu
•	Password: Ubuntu

2.	Set the number of processors to 2 CPU’s and ram to 1GB.

3.	Set network adapter to host-only adapter.

4.	Start the Clickos 

5.	Extract the zip files. The zip files contains six  files – 

•	arpmitigate.cc, 
•	arpmitigate.hh, 
•	headerverifier.cc, 
•	headerverifier.hh 
•	try.click, 
•	myinstance.xen
•	arp-replay-edited.pcap

6.	In ClickOS home directory:
•	cd /home/ubuntu/cmpe210_clickos_setup/
•	sudo su
•	copy arpmitigate.cc, arpmitigator.hh headerverifier.cc and headerverifer.hh to “ /home/ubuntu/cmpe210_clickos_setup/clickos/elements/standard/”
•	Change directory back to “cmpe210_clickos_setup”
•	Run  “ ./install.clickos.sh” 
•	Copy try.click, myinstance.xen and arp-replay-edited.pcap to directory “cmpe210_clickos_setup”.

# Step b: Configuring the xen file and click file:
1.	Get superuser 
		“sudo su”
2.	“ cd /home/Ubuntu/cmpe210_clickos_setup/ ”
3.	“ usr/local/share/openvswitch/scripts/ovs-ctl start ” 

4.	 “ovs-vsctl show

5.	Incase of no bridge present , type 
			“ ovs-vsctl add-br xenbr0  “               
6.	Check which interface has an active host only IP (192.168.56.*) – pick eth1
7.	Ifconfig eth1 0
8.	Ifconfig xenbr0<ipaddress of eth1 noted above> netmask 255.255.255.0 up
9.	ovs-vsctl add-port xenbr0 eth1
10.	check if eth1 is added to bridge : “ovs-vsctl show”
11.	create xen configurance file in cmpe210_clickos_setup directory using: “xl create myinstance.xen ”
12.	 In th same directory type: “ ./cosmos/dist/bin/cosmos start clickos try.click “
13.	 Do “ xl list “ and check if the domain state as r (running) or sometime “ -----”.
